## Instructions

Something seems wrong... This README doesn't have the detailed instructions!

**Hint**: The full workshop instructions were here in a previous commit. Can you use Git to find them?

Try using commands like:
- `git log` to see the commit history
- `git show <commit-hash>` to view a specific commit
- `git revert` or `git reset` to restore previous versions

Good luck!
